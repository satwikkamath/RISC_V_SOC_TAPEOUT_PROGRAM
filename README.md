## ðŸ“š About the Program

The **RISC-V Tapeout Program** is a hands-on program designed to give participants practical experience in RISC-V processor design, verification, and tapeout processes. It covers:

- Installation and setup of EDA tools
- RTL design and simulation
- Synthesis and timing analysis
- Physical design preparation
- Weekly tasks and reports
